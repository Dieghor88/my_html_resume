## MY FIRST HTML/CSS RÉSUMÉ

---
### As I am learning HTML/CSS, I came across the idea that a good project to begin practicing would be to make my résumé as an HTML/CSS webpage. I am a graphic designer so my réumé was originally made entirely on Photoshop and Illustrator. That was a bit of a challenge, especially with the graphic elements of the page, but I believe I was able to make the HTML/CSS page a lot like the PDF file (attached here for comparison). It is still not complete but I just can't make it stop moving around as I resize the browser window. But I will keep looking for a way to fix this issue.
